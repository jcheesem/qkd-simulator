Encode short messages of ASCII text with a simple quantum key distribution simulation.

This is not actually secure encryption. This is an educational web simulation to demonstrate the steps of BB84 protocol.

Code was generated using gpt-5 and claude-4-5-sonnet in Stanford's AI Playground.
Project part of Physics 19N course at Stanford University.

BB84 protocol steps referenced from Thomas G. Wong's _Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing_ online textbook, IBM's Quantum Learning Platform's module on Quantum Key Distribution found here: https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/quantum-key-distribution, and a Medium article on "Quantum Key Distribution and BB84 Protocol" by 'MR.Asif' found here: https://medium.com/quantum-untangled/quantum-key-distribution-and-bb84-protocol-6f03cc6263c5
